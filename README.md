## Development

Welcome to Rails.  You'll need Postgres set up locally.

```
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec rake db:setup
```

## Testing

For integration testing, we use [@fakemovaccount](https://twitter.com/fakemovaccount).

```
$ bundle exec rspec
```

## Deployment

Use Heroku.

Later, make sure the Twitter app has a Callback URL set in the Settings tab.
Otherwise you'll see a 401 error from Omniauth.
